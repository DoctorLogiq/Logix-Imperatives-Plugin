# Logix-Imperatives-Plugin
A Spigot 1.15.1 plugin which adds a bunch of useful features designed to not affect gameplay in any way, but to improve the overall user experience.

## Under development
Version 0.2.0 is currently under development. This is a complete re-write, to optimise some features and fix a bunch of bugs. The plugin has not been working as intended and has been showing different behaviour on live servers from my testing server. I would love to call this version 1.0.0 and just remove the old versions from existence but that would be easier said than done.

## Server owners
Once 0.2.0 is live (this page will be updated), please update to it immediately. Be aware that the config will have changed, so you will need to reconfigure it.
