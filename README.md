# Logix Imperatives
This is a Spigot 1.15.1 plugin which adds a bunch of useful features designed to not affect gameplay in any way, but to improve the overall user experience.

## Under development
This plugin is currently under heavy development. This is a complete re-write, to optimise some features and fix a bunch of bugs. The plugin has not been working as intended and has been showing different behaviour on live servers from my testing server.

## Server owners
Please remove any version of the plugin you currently have. Once v1.0.0 is released (this page will be updated), you may switch to it. This will be the start of a brand new branch which will have a much better version control system (hence the removal of older versions).
