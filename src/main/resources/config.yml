# Formatting codes use the section symbol ( § ). On Windows, you can type this by holding ALT and pressing
#   2, then 1, on the numpad, then releasing ALT. Alternatively, you can copy-paste it.
# Wildcards are used where we don't want to essentially hard-code something (such as a formatting code). It is
#   strongly recommended to keep them wherever they are used, in order to maintain plugin functionality.
